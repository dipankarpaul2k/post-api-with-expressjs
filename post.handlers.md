## Flow

1. The `homeRoute` function renders the home page and returns a HTML string with a button linking to the `/posts` route.
2. The `getAllPost` function retrieves all posts from the `fakePosts` array and returns them as an array of post objects.
3. The `getPostById` function takes a post ID as a parameter, searches for the post with the given ID in the `fakePosts` array, and returns the corresponding post object.
4. The `addPost` function creates a new post object with a unique ID generated using the `uuidv4` function, adds it to the `fakePosts` array, and returns the new post object as the response.
5. The `updatePost` function takes a post ID and updated post data as parameters, searches for the post with the given ID in the `fakePosts` array, updates its properties with the new values, replaces the old post with the updated post in the array, and returns the updated post object as the response.
6. The `deletePost` function takes a post ID as a parameter, finds the index of the post with the given ID in the `fakePosts` array, removes the post from the array, and returns a success message as the response.
