# Code Analysis

## Inputs

- `express`: The Express.js library used to create the router.
- `postController`: An object containing functions that handle different post-related requests.

---

## Flow

1. Import the necessary modules and create an Express router.
2. Register the route handlers for different HTTP methods using the router's methods (`get`, `post`, `patch`, `delete`).
3. Each route handler is associated with a specific URL path and a corresponding function from the `postController` object.
4. The route handlers are responsible for processing the incoming requests and sending the appropriate responses.

---

## Outputs

- The `router` object, which contains the registered route handlers, is exported as the default module.
